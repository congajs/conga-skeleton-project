# conga-skeleton-project

This is a minimal project to get started with conga.js. It just includes the core @conga/framework and allows you to create annotated controllers which pass through the default JSON response handler.

Use this as a basis for a project and expand it with additional bundles to add template response handlers, database access, security, etc.
